This is a placeholder for the actual eBook PDF file.

In production, you would replace this with the actual "AI Reality Check: What You Aren't Doing, What You Can Do, What You Will Be Able to Do" eBook PDF.

For security reasons, consider storing the actual file in a secure cloud storage service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Vercel Blob Storage, and serve it through signed URLs rather than storing it directly in the public directory.

This placeholder ensures the download functionality works during development and testing.
